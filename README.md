Data Science Internship Projects at CODSOFT
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the projects I completed during my data science internship at CODSOFT. Below, you'll find details about each project and how to navigate the repository.


Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

In this project, I used machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset used contains various features about passengers, such as their age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

Files:
Titanic_sc.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
titanic.csv: The dataset used for this project.


Project 2: Iris Flower Classification

For this project, I worked on classifying Iris flowers into different species using machine learning algorithms. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of data science, and I used it to build a classification model.

Files:
Iris_flower_sc.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
IRIS.csv: The dataset used for this project.


Project 3: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

In this project, I developed a movie rating prediction system using Python. I utilized recommendation algorithms and collaborative filtering techniques to provide movie ratings for users based on their historical preferences.

Files:
Movie_rating_sc.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
IMDb_dataset.csv: The dataset used, containing movie and user rating information.
